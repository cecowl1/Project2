                <p>Limelight is a sensitive rendition of the classic high contrast art deco style geometric sans serif. This style is often used to suggest the 1920's time period as well as the theatre generally and hollywood filmmaking in particular. Because of the extreme contrast of the design it will perform most reliably on web pages at medium and large font sizes. </p>

                <p>Raleway is an elegant sans-serif typeface family. Initially designed by Matt McInerney as a single thin weight, it was expanded into a 9 weight family by Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida in 2012 and iKerned by Igino Marini. A thorough review and italic was added in 2016.

                <p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type (text characters) to make written language legible, readable, and visually appealing. It encompasses various aspects of how letters, numbers, and symbols are designed, organized, and presented in both print and digital media. Typography is a crucial element in design, and it plays a significant role in shaping the visual communication of written content.  </p>

            <div class="opt2">
                <p> Typeface refers to a specific design of a set of characters, such as Arial, Times New Roman, or Helvetica. A font, on the other hand, is a specific size, weight (e.g., regular, bold), and style (e.g., italic) of a typeface. Typefaces and fonts have their own unique visual characteristics.
            </div>   
           <div class="opt3">
                <p>Typography helps establish a hierarchy of information, making it clear to the reader which elements are most important. This can be achieved through variations in font size, weight, style, color, and spacing.</p>

            <div class="opt4">
                <p>Text can be aligned in various ways, including left-aligned, right-aligned, centered, and justified (evenly aligned on both sides). The choice of alignment can affect the visual flow and readability of the text. </p>
